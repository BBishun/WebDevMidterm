            particularly their emotional reception to his gifts.
            He is helpful to Chihiro because she helped him, whereas after observing the bathhouse staff's reaction to gold and his own attempts to win them over with more gold,
            he reacts to their greed by becoming a grotesque monster which eats lots of food and some of the staff.

            At the end, she is very happy for Chihiro when she finally manages to find her way home.</p>
